Cloud Engineer Intern Assignment:-
Project Overview
Welcome to my Cloud Engineer Intern Assignment project! The primary objective of this assignment is to deploy and manage a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Docker. Specifically, the challenge is to solve the maximum path sum problem in a binary tree.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is twofold:
1) Technical Proficiency: Demonstrate proficiency in containerization with Docker and deployment on GCP, utilizing services like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Google Compute Engine.
2) Problem-Solving: Implement an efficient solution to the maximum path sum problem in a binary tree, ensuring scalability and reliability in a cloud environment.

Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the maximum path sum of any non-empty path in the tree. Each path is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Technologies Used:
Docker for containerization
Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for container orchestration and management
Monitoring tools

To achieve this, I've containerized the solution using Docker, ensuring consistency and security across different environmentsâ€”development, testing, and production. Leveraging AWS's robust infrastructure, I used Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for orchestrating and managing these Docker containers, ensuring scalability and reliability in a cloud-native environment. Additionally, Amazon EC2 instances were utilized through Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for additional compute resources as needed.
